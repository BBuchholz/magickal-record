# magickal-record

Magickal Record was an idea I had that was heavily
thought out in the planning stages regarding various
things I wanted to do with a digital version of 
a magickal record, sometimes called a Book of Shadows, 
or even the more generalized Hermetic Grimoire.

The planning was done with initial intentions to become
a site that offered user accounts, but as time went on
I felt like a markdown repository would be more 
appropriate given the personalized nature of the 
subject matter (ie. not everyone, myself included, 
wants their personal spiritual journal online...)

I am currently using Obsidian to handle my markdown
files, and these are simply utility tools I am writing
to shape those markdown files into the vision I 
originally had for the site.

It's a personal project and may only ever be for me,
but I'm open to collaboration for anyone interested 
in general usage so feel free to reach out to me
if so inclined. (Interested individuals or groups 
can message me through GitHub)
