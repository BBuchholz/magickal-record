"We see the star within when we reflect upon the depths of our experiences. The light reflected will indeed be rooted in the light that we have gathered through those experiences, but the ripples and agitations of the inner poolings will inevitably leave their own distortions upon how that light is refracted into our inner vision. Every man and every woman is a star, whose light is prismatically unique because of this process."

Indeed, the mere suggestion of being the best is a potent lure that keeps many ever striving upwards from the gutter to the top, stumbling over each other in their frenzy. Such pursuits are a deceptive trap, and the sage knows real game hones itself in the depths of the pit, not the luxuries of the palace."
